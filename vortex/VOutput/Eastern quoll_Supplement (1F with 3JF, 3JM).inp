Extinction defined as no males or no females.

Species Description Notes: Coarse

Inbreeding depression with a genetic load consisting of 
  6.29 total lethal equivalents per individual, of which
  50% are due to recessive lethals,
  and the remainder are lethal equivalents not subjected to removal by selection.

Populations:

  MFWS

Individual state variables
  IS1: DependentOffspring    Initialization: 0    Birth function: 0    Transition: =IS1


Reproductive System:

  Polygyny, with new selection of mates each year
  Females breed from age 1 to age 3
  Males breed from age 1 to age 2
  Maximum age of survival: 3
  Sex ratio (percent males) at birth: 50

Correlation of EV between reproduction and survival = 0.5

EV sampled from binomial distributions.


Population specific rates for MFWS

  Percent of adult females breeding each year: 100
    with EV(SD): 10
  Percent of adult males in the pool of breeders: 100
  Normal distribution of brood size with mean: 5 with SD: 1

  Female annual mortality rates (as percents):
    Age 0 to 1:    64.17 with EV(SD): 19.92
    After age 1:    8.77 with EV(SD): 6.25

  Male annual mortality rates (as percents):
    Age 0 to 1:    64.93 with EV(SD): 19.87
    After age 1:    10.69 with EV(SD): 5.6
